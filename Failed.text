❌ Failures Related to PDF or File Handling

1. No PDF Files in Input Folder
✅ Already handled (⚠️ No PDF files found...), so safe
2. Corrupted or Password-Protected PDF
Issue: pdfplumber will raise an exception if the PDF is corrupted or encrypted.
❗Fix: Add try-except around pdfplumber.open(file_path)
❌ Failures in PDF Content

3. Empty Pages
If page.extract_text() returns None, col1, col2, and col3 will be marked as “NOT FOUND”.
✅ This is handled, but if all pages are blank, the Excel will be mostly empty.
4. Unexpected Text Formats
If col1 or col2 patterns change even slightly (e.g., "B-1 of 10" → "Bundle 1/10"), regex won't match.
❗Fix: Use more flexible patterns or fallback strategies.
❌ OCR & Image Issues (col3)

5. Tesseract Not Installed or Misconfigured
If the Tesseract path is wrong, it’ll raise a runtime error.
❗Fix: Add a check at startup to confirm pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd exists
6. Image Conversion Fails
If page.to_image() fails (e.g., missing Ghostscript or PIL issues), fallback OCR won’t work.
7. OCR Gives Garbage or Incomplete Output
Poor scan quality, skewed text, or vertical characters can cause pytesseract to extract garbage.
Your fallback logic is good but may fail if:
Text is cut off in the crop
Characters are merged
Layout is inconsistent
8. Wrong Rotation Angle
You rotate the page 270°—if some PDFs are already upright or rotated differently, the OCR will miss col3 entirely.
❗Fix: Use page.rotation or a smarter angle detector
❌ Hardcoded Exceptions (Manual Override)

9. Manual Override for Pages 9 & 10 Only
You hardcoded if page_index + 1 == 9, etc.
❗Risk: If a different PDF has similar issues on page 5 or 6, these will be missed.
❌ Code & Runtime Issues

10. File Save Errors
If Excel or log files can’t be written (e.g., permissions, file in use), it’ll crash.
❗Fix: Add try-except around file save blocks.
11. Non-ASCII Filenames
If a PDF has special characters in the filename (e.g., Hindi characters), Excel or log saving might fail on some systems.
❌ Logic Fallacies

12. OCR Fallback Assumes Only One Match
You take the first match from OCR, but what if there are multiple similar patterns on the page? You might get the wrong one.
❌ Performance & Scalability

13. Large PDFs May Take Too Long
Time.sleep(1) + high-resolution image conversion can make large PDFs very slow.
